             <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
             <p>
              <strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
              </p>
              <p>
              Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
             </p>
             <h3>
              How I turned things around
             </h3>
             <p>
             <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>
              . I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
             <p>
              It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
             </p>
             <h3>
              >Now I live the simple life
             </h3>
             <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
             <p>With how much it turned my life around, I<strong> felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
